   arc(h,k,r,α, β)

       Custom function to help draw an arc of radius (r) with centre (h,k) and extending upto angles α & β. 
       Needed for the pitch arcs. 

   For example, 

       α = 0; β = 2π would give you a full circle.  
       α = 0; β = π would give you a semicircle. 

   Returns:
       arrays θ and h which are the points on the circumference of the arc defined by the parameters
